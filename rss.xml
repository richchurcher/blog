&lt;p&gt;Making a start on painting some monsters into this picture: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_6.html&quot;&gt;Chapter Six&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Viral]]></title><description><![CDATA[Well.

That was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s COVID-19 lockdown day 3 here in New Zealand. Discombobulating times. I could blame my inactivity in personal learning projects entirely on SARS-COV-2, but the truth is I’ve been conking out pretty early and consuming content without creating any. I hate that: feels like empty time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s see how many of these crisis days I can fill with creativity, when I’m not at my ‘day job’. Since I’m already a remote worker, I haven’t had to make too many adjustments in that department and I have absolutely no excuse not to stretch into learning a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we’re up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_5.html&quot;&gt;Chapter Five&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooo, field of view is interesting. But this room algorithm creates very tall, skinny rooms!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Green Walls]]></title><description><![CDATA[Chapter 3. Random walls.

I have some &lt;em&gt;programmerly&lt;/em&gt; reasons for that, the ones I know I’m supposed to approve of like memory safety, strong typing, sensible error handling, no garbage collector, and so on. On a personal level though, it just &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; elegant. Which is rather flimsy language to use to think about a technical topic, but I don’t care. It’s also a much-needed break from JavaScript/TypeScript which, as necessary as they are these days, still feel a bit tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a repentant dabbler in Rust for several years. I’ve been down the “write a Roguelike in Rust” road before, but never finished it. I hope to move past that phase now and Build Some Shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, that means the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_1.html&quot;&gt;first pages&lt;/a&gt; of Herbert’s tutorial are mostly old news, so I’m skimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll track this project at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/richchurcher/vimhack&quot;&gt;vimhack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Every Day]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since becoming a home owner for the first time, I’ve been enjoying things that have rhythm.

I’m trying to lever out a little time every day for personal learning and play, amid the Möbius-like stream of house-related tasks (buying a home built in the 1950s has its moments!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Roguelikes. I’m going to be doing a little of Herbert Wolverson’s excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_0.html&quot;&gt;Roguelike Tutorial - In Rust&lt;/a&gt; each day. I suspect sometimes a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; little.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Go Gatsby Again]]></title><description><![CDATA[Yup.]]></description><link>https://richchurcher.github.io/blog/go-gatsby-again/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://richchurcher.github.io/blog/go-gatsby-again/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 01:17:15 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Yup.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
