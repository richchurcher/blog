I like Rust. I have some *programmerly* reasons for that, the ones I know I'm supposed to approve of like memory safety, strong typing, sensible error handling, no garbage collector, and so on. On a personal level though, it just *feels* elegant. Which is rather flimsy language to use to think about a technical topic, but I don't care. It's also a much-needed break from JavaScript/TypeScript which, as necessary as they are these days, still feel a bit tiresome.

I've been a repentant dabbler in Rust for several years. I've been down the "write a Roguelike in Rust" road before, but never finished it. I hope to move past that phase now and Build Some Shit.

Still, that means the [first pages](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_1.html) of Herbert's tutorial are mostly old news, so I'm skimming.

We'll track this project at [vimhack](https://github.com/richchurcher/vimhack).
