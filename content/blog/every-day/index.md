Since becoming a home owner for the first time, I've been enjoying things that have rhythm. I'm trying to lever out a little time every day for personal learning and play, amid the MÃ¶bius-like stream of house-related tasks (buying a home built in the 1950s has its moments!)

I like Roguelikes. I'm going to be doing a little of Herbert Wolverson's excellent [Roguelike Tutorial - In Rust](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_0.html) each day. I suspect sometimes a *very* little.
